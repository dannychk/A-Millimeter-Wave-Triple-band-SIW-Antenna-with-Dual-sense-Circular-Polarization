## Response to comment 6:
The E-field distributions at the phase of 0째, 45째,90째and 135째 are shown as below. It shows the polarized state at 38 GHz is LHCP.

## Response to comment 7:
The comparison of different scales are show as following. The simulated frequency is shifted referring to the desired point.

## Response to comment 10:
The current, E-field and H-field distributions in SIW cavity at 38 GHz are shown below, and it is consistent with the TM210 mode in circular disk.
