## Response to comment 1:

The polaized state of the lower band can be tuned to linear polarization when the pair of notches in circular patch is removed as shown the following figure:

The following figure shows the S parameters and AR characteristic of this design. It can be verified that the polaized state at lower band is linear polarization while the upper band is circular polarization.

The polaized state at upper band is same to the lower band. The results of upper band is linear polarization are shown below:

The design figure that θ2 = 135°， and the radiation pattern are shown below:

The design figure that θ2 = 45°， and the radiation pattern are shown below, the simulated result also shows the beam direction of lower band is deflected to -12°, while the previous design is 13°。
