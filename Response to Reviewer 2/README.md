Response to comment 1:

The polaized state of the lower band can be tuned to linear polarization when the pair of notches in circular patch is removed as shown the following figure:

The following figure shows the S parameters and AR characteristic of this design. It can be verified that the polaized state at lower band is linear polarization while the upper band is circular polarization.

There two giures show the simulated axial ratio (AR) of the proposed Antenna.

The comparison of different scales are show as following:
