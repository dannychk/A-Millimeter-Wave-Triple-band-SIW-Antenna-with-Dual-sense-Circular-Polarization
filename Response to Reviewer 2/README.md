## Response to comment 1:

Thank you very much for your comments and advices. The proposed triple-band antenna is single-feed, and initially all the three bands are linear polarized. Two pairs of notches are introduced into the slot and patch to perturb the fundamental resonant mode into two orthogonal degenerate modes for CP radiation at upper and lower bands. The notches have no effects on middle band, so it is linear polarization at middle band. For upper and lower band, by placing the notches along the other diagonal direction, the rotation of CP can be changed to the opposite one. If we remove the notches, CP will transfer to LP at upper and lower band. Some simulated results are shown as following to explain this problem. Although these results can’t be wholly presented in the paper due to the limitation of space, we have made a brief discussion on this problem in Section IV of the revised manuscript. When the pair of notches on the patch is removed, the antenna structure and corresponding S11 and AR results are shown in the following figure. The CP at the lower band disappears and it has transferred into LP. <div align=center><img src="https://github.com/dannychk/A-Millimeter-Wave-Triple-band-SIW-Antenna-with-Dual-sense-Circular-Polarization/blob/master/Response to Reviewer 2/Lower_LP_RD.png" width="300" height="250" /></div>

When the pair of notches on the SIW slot is removed, the antenna structure and corresponding S11 and AR results are shown in the following figure. In this case, the CP at the upper band disappears and it has transferred into LP.

## Response to comment 4:

The beam deflection is due to the asymmetry of the circular patch caused by the notches, and this statement is added in the revised manuscript. The following simulated result also shows the beam direction of lower band is deflected to -13° when the angle θ_2 is set as 45°, which further proves the deflection results from the asymmetry caused by notches. This result can’t be added into the manuscript due to the limitation of space, however we think it will not affect the readability of the whole paper.

The design figure that θ2 = 45°， and the radiation pattern are shown below, the simulated result also shows the beam direction of lower band is deflected to -12°, while the previous design is 13°。
